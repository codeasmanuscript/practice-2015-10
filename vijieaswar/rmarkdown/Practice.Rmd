This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Intro

## Citing a study
```{r}



#how to enter here from papers. need to export the bib key
#@some bibkey
#[] will make the round bracketts around the citation. 
```

```{r}


#* makes the text in italics
#** on either side will bold words
#``` is a code block

#` having things in line
# > indicates that it is goin to be quote 
# @ with bib key will extract refs

#YAML header is for R to know what to do. YAML has o be closed in ---

#pander, kable creates tables
#ggplot qplot creates figure

#conrol+shift+K will knit html
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(pander)
library(captioner)

#install.packages('captioner', type = 'source') if you get an error message while installing

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
#Can use this above ling to apply to every chunk

#table option 1
knitr::kable(summary(cars))


#table option 2 
tabNums <- captioner(prefix = 'Table')
figNums <- captioner(prefix = 'Figure')
cars_cap <- figNums('carsFig', 'This is a caption for the figure')


pander(lm(cars), caption = tabNums('tab1', 'This is the caption for table 1')) #first coloumn as Y, and second column as X. if you have many columns, 2nd 3rd columnds are X2, X3 etc.


```

REference to **`r tabNums('tab1', display = 'cite')`**.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=cars_cap}
#have to write fig.caps = cars_cap because knitr is finicky

plot(cars)
```

```{r}
#Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#`r will take the following stuff within ` as a command. if you dont write r after ` it will take it as text
#compare `r mean(cars$dist)` with `mean(cars$dist)`
```

#Tables
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

cars %>% 
  gather(Measure, Value) %>% 
  group_by(Measure) %>% 
  summarise(means =mean(Value) %>%  round(2)) %>% 
  pander()
  
```  

# Figures
## Scatterplot

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=5, dpi=150, dev='png'}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(dist,speed, data = cars, geom= 'point')

```

This is a list

- There is `r length(cars)` rows in `cars`
- There are `r dim(cars)[2]` variables in `cars`

you would add ` ` around the cars to differentiate it from regular text

This is a quote:

> to be or not to be 

```{r}
#command+option+i is a new R chunk
#command+alt+c runs the R chunk


```
